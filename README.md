# Semantic-Segmentation-on-Indian-Driving-Dataset
The objective is to Design an Efficient Deep learning Algorithm to perform Semantic segmentation for Road scene understanding in unstructured environments for Autonomous Navigation using Indian Driving Dataset (IDD) dataset.
Used State of the art Deep Neural Networks like DeeplabV3, Pspnet, etc with MIOU (Mean Intersection-Over-Union) as Performance Metric.
